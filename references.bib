  abstract = {The high concentrations of methane in the vent fluids of the Lost City Hydrothermal Field represent the sum of abiotic and biological sources and sinks. Stable isotopes of carbon are of limited value in discriminating between the various sources of methane because the isotope effects associated with the multiple processes forming and consuming methane are each poorly constrained, and the products of these processes are pooled. Furthermore, reservoir effects complicate interpretation: the near quantitative reduction of inorganic carbon to methane under highly reducing conditions limits the isotope effects associated with methanogenesis. However, the carbon isotope compositions of lipids derived from anaerobic methanotrophs suggest that more than one isotopically distinct pool of methane exists at Lost City. In this analysis we integrate multiple lines of evidence to constrain the relative contribution of various processes at Lost City. The processes that we consider here include i) Fischer--Tropsch-type (FTT) abiotic synthesis of methane and other hydrocarbons, ii) the Sabatier process for the abiotic synthesis of methane alone, iii) biological methane production by Methanosarcinales, and iv) biological methane consumption by anaerobic and aerobic methanotrophs. This analysis suggests that abiotic processes, particularly the Sabatier reaction, are likely to be the dominant source of methane at Lost City. Biological methane is present in the vent fluids, but does not compose a high fraction of the total methane pool. These observations imply that ultramafic systems could have supplied abundant reduced carbon to the early Earth, even without biological catalysis.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT Hydrothermal venting and the formation of carbonate chimneys in the Lost City hydrothermal field (LCHF) are driven predominantly by serpentinization reactions and cooling of mantle rocks, resulting in a highly reducing, high-pH environment with abundant dissolved hydrogen and methane. Phylogenetic and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analyses of 16S rRNA genes in fluids and carbonate material from this site indicate the presence of organisms similar to sulfur-oxidizing, sulfate-reducing, and methane-oxidizing Bacteria as well as methanogenic and anaerobic methane-oxidizing Archaea. The presence of these metabolic groups indicates that microbial cycling of sulfur and methane may be the dominant biogeochemical processes active within this ultramafic rock-hosted environment. 16S rRNA gene sequences grouping within the Methylobacter and Thiomicrospira clades were recovered from a chemically diverse suite of carbonate chimney and fluid samples. In contrast, 16S rRNA genes corresponding to the Lost City Methanosarcinales phylotype were found exclusively in high-temperature chimneys, while a phylotype of anaerobic methanotrophic Archaea (ANME-1) was restricted to lower-temperature, less vigorously venting sites. A hyperthermophilic habitat beneath the LCHF may be reflected by 16S rRNA gene sequences belonging to Thermococcales and uncultured Crenarchaeota identified in vent fluids. The finding of a diverse microbial ecosystem supported by the interaction of high-temperature, high-pH fluids resulting from serpentinization reactions in the subsurface provides insight into the biogeochemistry of what may be a pervasive process in ultramafic subseafloor environments.},

  abstract = {The alkaline, H2-rich vent fluids of the Lost City Hydrothermal Field (LCHF) have generally been attributed to serpentinization of tectonically uplifted mantle peridotite. However, elevated concentrations of highly incompatible and fluid mobile trace alkali metals, Rb and Cs, indicate reaction with relatively unaltered mafic components (Seyfried et al., 2015). Here, we present high-precision stable-K isotope analyses of LCHF vent fluids, which provide new constraints on source-rock lithology and support more quantitative estimates of fluid:rock ratio, providing a new constraint on heat and mass transfer processes. We find that {$\delta$}41K values of LCHF vent fluids (0.03--0.07~‰) are distinct from local seawater (0.13~{\textpm}~0.02~‰). In combination with near-seawater concentrations of K (10.4~{\textpm}~0.1~mmol/kg), these data are incompatible with hydrothermal alteration of peridotite alone, which is highly depleted in K. Instead, K-isotope and concentration data are consistent with hydrothermal alteration of mafic rocks (e.g., gabbro or diabase) at a fluid:rock ratio of 6--26, a range that agrees well with Rb, Cs, and 87Sr/86Sr-based estimates of fluid:rock ratio, updated here to reflect derivation from mafic source rocks. Geochemical modeling of hydrothermal fluid-rock reactions indicates that LCHF vent fluids can be effectively reproduced by a two-stage reaction in which seawater initially reacts at 200--300~{$^\circ$}C with mafic rocks at in a fluid:rock ratio of~{$\sim~$}10 ---as constrained by the above isotopic and trace-element systematics--- and subsequently reacts with peridotite at a fluid:rock ratio of~{$\sim~$}30 at roughly the same temperature, pressure conditions. We also note that LCHF vent fluids are~{$\sim~$}2~\% depleted in Cl compared to seawater, which may reflect admixture of a vapor component derived from ongoing phase separation at higher ({$>$} 450~{$^\circ$}C) temperatures. We thus propose that the LCHF represents waning-stage hydrothermal activity initiated by a discrete off-axis mafic intrusion that has subsequently cooled to intermediate temperatures conducive to olivine hydrolysis and production of alkaline vent fluids. In this interpretation, alkaline H2-rich vent fields occupy a narrow thermal window in the expected evolution of hydrothermal activity associated with episodic off-axis mafic intrusions into tectonically exposed ultramafic host rocks and are thus likely to be rare on the modern seafloor.},

Here, we present new analyses of micronutrient transition metal concentrations in vent fluids from the iconic Lost City Hydrothermal Field (LCHF) and report concentrations of Fe~=~2.9--18.3~{\textmu}mol/kg, Zn~=~1.30--5.86~{\textmu}mol/kg, Cu~=~0.43--5.06~{\textmu}mol/kg, Ni~=~86.4--556~nmol/kg, Mn~=~8.3--274~nmol/kg, V~=~25.9--127~nmol/kg, Mo~=~24--94~nmol/kg, Co~=~8.0--135~nmol/kg, W~=~4.8--16~nmol/kg, and Cd~=~1.7--4.5~nmol/kg. We additionally present results of a hydrothermal lherzolite alteration experiment conducted at 300~{$^\circ$}C, 500~bar. Transition metal concentrations and major chemical parameters of experimental reaction fluids are broadly similar to LCHF vent fluids, indicating that transition metal concentrations in LCHF vent fluids, and alkaline hydrothermal fluids more generally, reflect metal solubility controlled by underlying rock-buffered hydrothermal reactions. Concentrations of Ni and Mo are especially noteworthy because of their recognized importance for biological methanogenesis (Ni) and nitrogen fixation (Mo). When compared with known biological thresholds, our findings indicate that Ni concentrations in LCHF vent fluids are sufficient to support the robust methane-metabolizing microbial communities observed in the immediate vicinity of LCHF vents and suggest that Ni availability influences the spatial distribution of LCHF methanogens. Furthermore, our laboratory hydrothermal experiments demonstrate that Mo concentrations of similar magnitude to those observed in LCHF vent fluids (and also modern seawater) can be obtained by hydrothermal alteration of ultramafic rocks with Mo-free (Na, Ca) Cl aqueous solution. Thus, we conclude that alkaline hydrothermal fluids were likely similarly enriched in Mo prior to oxidation of the Earth's atmosphere and ocean, providing localized Mo-rich geochemical environments capable of supporting Mo-dependent nitrogen fixation at currently recognized threshold concentrations.},

Here we report the discovery of an extensive hydrothermal field at 30{$^\circ$}\,N near the eastern intersection of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and the Atlantis fracture zone. The vent field---named `Lost City'---is distinctly different from all other known sea-floor hydrothermal fields in that it is located on 1.5-Myr-old crust, nearly 15\,km from the spreading axis, and may be driven by the heat of exothermic serpentinization reactions between sea water and mantle rocks. It is located on a dome-like massif and is dominated by steep-sided carbonate chimneys, rather than the sulphide structures typical of `black smoker' hydrothermal fields. We found that vent fluids are relatively cool (40--75\,{$^\circ$}C) and alkaline (pH 9.0--9.8), supporting dense microbial communities that include anaerobic thermophiles. Because the geological characteristics of the Atlantis massif are similar to numerous areas of old crust along the Mid-Atlantic, Indian and Arctic ridges, these results indicate that a much larger portion of the oceanic crust may support hydrothermal activity and microbial life than previously thought.},

Detailed examination of 160 samples from ultraslow- to fast-spreading midocean ridges, subduction zones, and ophiolites revealed that hydrogen (H2) and CH4 formation linked to serpentinization within olivine-hosted secondary fluid inclusions is a widespread process. Fluid inclusion contents are dominated by serpentine, brucite, and magnetite, as well as CH4(g) and H2(g) in varying proportions, consistent with serpentinization under strongly reducing, closed-system conditions. Thermodynamic constraints indicate that aqueous fluids entering the upper mantle or lower oceanic crust are trapped in olivine as secondary fluid inclusions at temperatures higher than {$\sim$}400 {$^\circ$}C. When temperatures decrease below {$\sim$}340 {$^\circ$}C, serpentinization of olivine lining the walls of the fluid inclusions leads to a near-quantitative consumption of trapped liquid H2O. The generation of molecular H2 through precipitation of Fe(III)-rich daughter minerals results in conditions that are conducive to the reduction of inorganic carbon and the formation of CH4. Once formed, CH4(g) and H2(g) can be stored over geological timescales until extracted by dissolution or fracturing of the olivine host. Fluid inclusions represent a widespread and significant source of abiotic CH4 and H2 in submarine and subaerial vent systems on Earth, and possibly elsewhere in the solar system.},

Isotopic evidence is consistent with an abiotic formation mechanism for formate, perhaps during serpentinization processes in the sub-surface. Further support comes from previous studies where the abiological formation of low molecular weight organic acids has been shown to be thermodynamically favorable during hydrothermal alteration of olivine, and laboratory studies in which the reduction of carbon dioxide to formate has been confirmed. As the second most prevalent carbon species after methane, formate may be an important substrate to microbial communities in an environment where dissolved inorganic carbon is limited. Acetate is found in locations where sulfate reduction is believed to be important and is likely to be a microbial by-product, formed either directly by autotrophic metabolic activity or indirectly during the fermentative degradation of larger organic molecules. Given the common occurrence of exposed ultramafic rocks and active serpentinization within the worlds ocean basins, the abiotic formation of formate may be an important process supporting life in these high pH environments and may have critical implications to understanding the organic precursors from which life evolved.},

Such environments provide unique habitats for microbial communities capable of utilizing these reduced compounds in present-day and, possibly, early Earth environments. However, these systems present challenges to microbial communities as well, particularly due to high fluid pH and possibly the availability of essential nutrients such as nitrogen. Here we investigate the source and cycling of organic nitrogen at an oceanic serpentinizing environment, the Lost City hydrothermal field (30{$^\circ$}N, Mid-Atlantic Ridge). Total hydrolizable amino acid (THAA) concentrations in the fluids range from 736 to 2300 nm and constitute a large fraction of the dissolved organic carbon (2.5--15.1\%). The amino acid distributions, and the relative concentrations of these compounds across the hydrothermal field, indicate they most likely derived from chemolithoautotrophic production. Previous studies have identified the presence of numerous nitrogen fixation genes in the fluids and the chimneys. Organic nitrogen in actively venting chimneys has {$\delta$}15N values as low as 0.1‰ which is compatible with biological nitrogen fixation. Total hydrolizable amino acids in the chimneys are enriched in 13C by 2--7‰ compared to bulk organic matter. The distribution and absolute {$\delta$}13CTHAA values are compatible with a chemolithoautotrophic source, an attribution also supported by molar organic C/N ratios in most active chimneys (4.1--5.5) which are similar to those expected for microbial communities. In total, these data indicate nitrogen is readily available to microbial communities at Lost City.},

  abstract = {Hydrogen produced during water-rock serpentinization reactions can drive the synthesis of organic compounds both biotically and abiotically. We investigated abiotic carbon production and microbial metabolic pathways at the high energy but low diversity serpentinite-hosted Lost City hydrothermal field. Compound-specific 14C data demonstrates that formate is mantle-derived and abiotic in some locations and has an additional, seawater-derived component in others. Lipids produced by the dominant member of the archaeal community, the Lost City Methanosarcinales, largely lack 14C, but metagenomic evidence suggests they cannot use formate for methanogenesis. Instead, sulfatereducing bacteria may be the primary consumers of formate in Lost City chimneys. Paradoxically, the archaeal phylotype that numerically dominates the chimney microbial communities appears ill  suited to live in pure hydrothermal fluids without the co-occurrence of organisms that can liberate CO2. Considering the lack of dissolved inorganic carbon in such systems, the ability to utilize formate may be a key trait for survival in pristine serpentinite-hosted environments.},

  abstract = {Large volumes of seawater have passed through the rocky subseafloor throughout Earth's history. The scale of circulation is sufficiently large to impact the cycling of marine dissolved organic carbon (DOC), one of the largest pools of reduced carbon on Earth whose sources and sinks remain enigmatic, and to sequester carbon over geologic timescales. While the fate of DOC in numerous mafic systems has been examined, no previous reports are available on the less studied but still abundant ultramafic systems. We analyzed the concentration and composition of DOC from the Lost City hydrothermal field (30{$^\circ$}N, Mid-Atlantic Ridge), a long-lived ultramafic system with minimal magmatic input. We show that per liter of seawater, more DOC is removed and a rate {$>$}650 times faster rate than in mafic ridge flank systems. Simultaneously, newly synthesized 14C-free organics are exported into the water column, adding a pre-aged component to the deep DOC pool. The sequestration of oceanic organic molecules onto minerals could partially account for the substantial total organic carbon present in ultramafic rocks, which is currently interpreted as evidence of chemoautotrophy or abiotic synthesis.},

  abstract = {Water that flows through permeable ultramafic rocks produces high abundances of molecular hydrogen (H2), methane (CH4), and other small organic molecules. Such products can fuel life in the rocky subseafloor, be extracted for energy, and may have played a role in pre-biological chemical synthesis on early Earth or other planetary bodies. The International Ocean Discovery Program drilled a new 1268-m-deep borehole (U1601C) into serpentinized mantle with minor gabbroic rocks on the Atlantis Massif, {$\sim$}800-m north of the Lost City hydrothermal field (30{$^\circ$}N, Mid-Atlantic Ridge). Measured temperatures of the disturbed borehole reached 91.3~{$^\circ$}C, and equilibrated temperatures of the deepest section are estimated to be between 110 -- 140~{$^\circ$}C. Water collected every~{$\sim~$}5-m during drilling operations had H2 concentrations that were regularly~{$>~$}200~nM and spiked to~{$>~$}10~{\textmu}M at multiple depths. In these waters, carbon monoxide was only present in deeper, hotter sections, and potentially associated with gabbroic intrusions into the peridotite host. Open borehole fluids were sampled after drilling and samples recovered from the deepest portion contained elevated short-lived 222-Radon and strontium isotope ratios similar to Lost City fluids, pointing to the presence of in situ subseafloor formation waters that have equilibrated with the host rock. The deepest samples were actively degassing upon recovery and contained 740~{\textpm}~360~{\textmu}M H2, 340~{\textpm}~36~{\textmu}M CH4, and 25.5~{\textmu}M {$\sum$}formate (= formate and formic acid). The shallowest fluids from the open borehole also contain micromolar H2 and {$\sum$}formate concentrations, the presence of which cannot be attributed to the upward migration of the deeper, higher concentration fluids. We interpret these data as reflecting two distinct and interconnected regimes of fluid flow and composition. Deep waters that are channelized along faults, lithologic contacts, and other high permeability pathways host high H2 and CH4 concentrations plus micromolar {$\sum$}formate that closely mirror the chemistry and isotopic signatures of LCHF vent fluids. Pervasive fluid flow permeates the mesh texture and microfracture network of the serpentinized peridotite and sustains H2 and {$\sum$}formate even in the shallowest subseafloor intervals at mild temperatures. These findings demonstrate that both focused and pervasive fluid flow contribute to the transport, and potentially the generation, of reduced volatiles and C1 compounds within the Atlantis Massif.},

  abstract = {The Lost City Hydrothermal Field (LCHF) is a serpentinite-hosted vent field located 15km west of the spreading axis of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. In this study, uranium--thorium (U--Th) geochronological techniques have been used to examine the U--Th systematics of hydrothermal fluids and the 230Th ages of hydrothermally-precipitated carbonate chimneys at the LCHF. Fluid sample analyses indicate that endmember fluids likely contain only 0.0073ng/g U or less compared to 3.28{\textpm}0.03ng/g of U in ambient seawater. For fluid samples containing only 2--21\% ambient seawater (1.1--11mmol/kgMg), Th concentration is 0.11--0.13pg/g and surrounding seawater concentrations average 0.133{\textpm}0.016pg/g. The 230Th/232Th atomic ratios of the vent fluids range from 1 ({\textpm}10){\texttimes}10-6 to 11 ({\textpm}5){\texttimes}10-6, are less than those of seawater, and indicate that the vent fluids may contribute a minor amount of non-radiogenic 230Th to the LCHF carbonate chimney deposits. Chimney 238U concentrations range from 1 to 10{$\mu$}g/g and the average chimney corrected initial {$\delta$}234U is 147.2{\textpm}0.8, which is not significantly different from the ambient seawater value of 146.5{\textpm}0.6. Carbonate 232Th concentrations range broadly from 0.0038{\textpm}0.0003 to 125{\textpm}16ng/g and 230Th/232Th atomic ratios vary from near seawater values of 43 ({\textpm}8){\texttimes}10-6 up to 530 ({\textpm}25){\texttimes}10-3. Chimney ages, corrected for initial 230Th, range from 17{\textpm}6yrs to 120{\textpm}13kyrs. The youngest chimneys are at the intersection of two active, steeply-dipping normal faults that cut the Atlantis Massif; the oldest chimneys are located in the southwest portion of the field. Vent deposits on a steep, fault-bounded wall on the east side of the field are all {$<$}4kyrs old, indicating that mass wasting in this region is relatively recent. Comparison of results to prior age-dating investigations of submarine hydrothermal systems shows that the LCHF is the most long-lived hydrothermal system known to date. It is likely that seismic activity and active faulting within the Atlantis Massif and the Atlantis Fracture Zone, coupled with volumetric expansion of the underlying serpentinized host rocks play major roles in sustaining hydrothermal activity at this site. The longevity of venting at the LCHF may have implications for ecological succession of microorganisms within serpentinite-hosted vent environments.},

  abstract = {This thesis examines the controls on organic, inorganic, and volatile species distributions in hydrothermal fluids venting at Von Damm and Piccard, two vent fields at the ultraslow spreading Mid-Cayman Rise, Earth's deepest mid-ocean ridge. In Chapter 2, abiotic organic synthesis is shown to occur via two distinct mechanisms in the serpentinizing Von Damm system. Chapters 3 and 4 present in-depth studies of the chemical and isotopic compositions of aqueous species in vent fluids at Von Damm and Piccard to elucidate the role of reaction temperature, pressure, substrate composition, and water/rock mass ratios during the chemical evolution of hydrothermal fluids. At Von Damm, sequential reaction of gabbroic and peridotite substrates at intermediate temperatures can explain generation of the observed fluids. At Piccard, extremely high temperature subsurface water/rock reaction results in fluids that are richer in dissolved H2 than any previously observed fluids worldwide. In Chapter 5, multiple sulfur isotopes were measured on metal sulfide deposits, S0, and fluid H2S to constrain sulfur sources and the isotopic systematics of precipitation in a wide variety of seafloor hydrothermal vents. Areas studied include the eastern Manus Basin and Lau Basin back-arc spreading centers, the unsedimented basalt-hosted Southern East Pacific Rise, and the sediment-hosted Guaymas Basin mid-ocean ridge spreading centers.},

  abstract = {Arguments for an abiotic origin of low-molecular weight organic compounds in deep-sea hot springs are compelling owing to implications for the sustenance of deep biosphere microbial communities and their potential role in the origin of life. Theory predicts that warm H2-rich fluids, like those emanating from serpentinizing hydrothermal systems, create a favorable thermodynamic drive for the abiotic generation of organic compounds from inorganic precursors. Here, we constrain two distinct reaction pathways for abiotic organic synthesis in the natural environment at the Von Damm hydrothermal field and delineate spatially where inorganic carbon is converted into bioavailable reduced carbon. We reveal that carbon transformation reactions in a single system can progress over hours, days, and up to thousands of years. Previous studies have suggested that CH4 and higher hydrocarbons in ultramafic hydrothermal systems were dependent on H2 generation during active serpentinization. Rather, our results indicate that CH4 found in vent fluids is formed in H2-rich fluid inclusions, and higher n-alkanes may likely be derived from the same source. This finding implies that, in contrast with current paradigms, these compounds may form independently of actively circulating serpentinizing fluids in ultramafic-influenced systems. Conversely, widespread production of formate by {$\Sigma$}CO2 reduction at Von Damm occurs rapidly during shallow subsurface mixing of the same fluids, which may support anaerobic methanogenesis. Our finding of abiogenic formate in deep-sea hot springs has significant implications for microbial life strategies in the present-day deep biosphere as well as early life on Earth and beyond.},

Although the abiotic formation of amino acids has been predicted both from experimental studies and thermodynamic calculations, its occurrence has not been demonstrated in terrestrial settings. Here, using a multimodal approach that combines high-resolution imaging techniques, we obtain evidence for the occurrence of aromatic amino acids formed abiotically and subsequently preserved at depth beneath the Atlantis Massif (Mid-Atlantic Ridge). These aromatic amino acids may have been formed through Friedel--Crafts reactions catalysed by an iron-rich saponite clay during a late alteration stage of the massif serpentinites. Demonstrating the potential of fluid-rock interactions in the oceanic lithosphere to generate amino acids abiotically gives credence to the hydrothermal theory for the origin of life, and may shed light on ancient metabolisms and the functioning of the present-day deep biosphere.},

Two new vent systems on the Mid-Cayman Rise each exhibits novel geologic settings and distinctively hydrogen-rich vent fluid compositions. We have determined and compared the chemistry, potential energy yielding reactions, abundance, community composition, diversity, and function of microbes in venting fluids from both sites: Piccard, the world's deepest vent site, hosted in mafic rocks; and Von Damm, an adjacent, ultramafic-influenced system. Von Damm hosted a wider diversity of lineages and metabolisms in comparison to Piccard, consistent with thermodynamic models that predict more numerous energy sources at ultramafic systems. There was little overlap in the phylotypes found at each site, although similar and dominant hydrogen-utilizing genera were present at both. Despite the differences in community structure, depth, geology, and fluid chemistry, energetic modelling and metagenomic analysis indicate near functional equivalence between Von Damm and Piccard, likely driven by the high hydrogen concentrations and elevated temperatures at both sites. Results are compared with hydrothermal sites worldwide to provide a global perspective on the distinctiveness of these newly discovered sites and the interplay among rocks, fluid composition and life in the subseafloor.},

We investigated all clusters and phylogenetic trees for 6.1 million protein coding genes from sequenced prokaryotic genomes in order to reconstruct the microbial ecology of LUCA. Among 286,514 protein clusters, we identified 355 protein families ({$\sim$}0.1\%) that trace to LUCA by phylogenetic criteria. Because these proteins are not universally distributed, they can shed light on LUCA's physiology. Their functions, properties and prosthetic groups depict LUCA as anaerobic, CO2-fixing, H2-dependent with a Wood--Ljungdahl pathway, N2-fixing and thermophilic. LUCA's biochemistry was replete with FeS clusters and radical reaction mechanisms. Its cofactors reveal dependence upon transition metals, flavins, S-adenosyl methionine, coenzyme A, ferredoxin, molybdopterin, corrins and selenium. Its genetic code required nucleoside modifications and S-adenosyl methionine-dependent methylations. The 355 phylogenies identify clostridia and methanogens, whose modern lifestyles resemble that of LUCA, as basal among their respective domains. LUCA inhabited a geochemically active environment rich in H2, CO2 and iron. The data support the theory of an autotrophic origin of life involving the Wood--Ljungdahl pathway in a hydrothermal setting.},
